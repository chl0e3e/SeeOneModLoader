# Overview

Currently, I have it so that it can patch FNA in to the executable found in the Steam directory (as long as Steam is running, it will find the correct path). Over the next few weeks I'll be adding a few patches to expand it into a mod framework and outlining the interfaces, classes, etc. which should hopefully produce something that is easy enough to work with.
